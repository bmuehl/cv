			<p>I&apos;m kind of a nerd.</p>

			<p>
				Whether it&apos;s keyboards, 3D printing or my homelab, I can spend hours tinkering with my
				&quot;smart&quot; home or my current programming setup.

			<h1 class="mb-4">Music</h1>

			<p>I love music.</p>

			<p>
				Since I started school, my path has always been closely linked to music. I love playing the
				guitar and I love going to concerts. I still need to work on my singing, though.

			<h1 class="mb-4">Sport</h1>

			<p>Let's get physical.</p>

			<p>
				In my free time I like to get out into the fresh air. Long hikes are very welcome,
				especially at the weekend. During the week a quick jog is enough. I have recently started
				playing tennis. However, there is a great need for improvement.
